# Hello, I am Emanuel ðŸ‘‹
I am a mathematician turned data scientist currently working at [crowdsec](https://crowdsec.net). I got into programming at 13 by writing minecraft mods and playing around with other peoples codebases is something that entertains me to this day. This is why I've set up this blog to document my side projects and present them to likeminded people. 

Feel free to contact me using the email at the bottom of the page.
