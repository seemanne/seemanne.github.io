# Introduction

Last week someone shared the repo [Infinite-Storage-Glitch](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch) to hackernews. For the uninitiated, the main idea is to use the fact that Youtube allows uploads of arbitrary lenght to get free unlimited cloud storage by encoding files to black-and-white videos. There are some intricacies surrounding the YouTube compression algorithm that need to be taken care of, but apart from that it is a good proof-of-concept.

In the ensuing discussion around exotic data storage, a user going by of phh [suggested the following](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34866808#34867655)

> You could use a reproducible LM (for instance using Bellard's NNCP as basis), and encode one bit in one word by taking the {first, second} most probable next word.  

Now this suggestion is reasonably infeasible, as we will see, but nevertheless

# Theory

# The code

# Conclusions

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
